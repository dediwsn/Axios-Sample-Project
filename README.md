# Axios-Sample-Project

A simple React-Native app that uses Axios to fetch data from remote API.

Download or clone the repo to get started. Use "yarn install" (or "npm install" if you don't have yarn) to get all the dependencies. 

Run "react-native start" to start up the JS server. Once that is done run "react-native run-android" to install the app-debug in your device or emulator.

Tested this project several times, it should work fine (I think).

Also, this goes without saying, but make sure you have a working internet connection in your device (or emulator) so that Axios can fetch the data.
